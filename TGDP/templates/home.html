          <h3><u>What Is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?</u></h3><br>
          <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services
            produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. As a broad measure of overall domestic
            production, it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given country’s economic health.
          <p>Though GDP is typically calculated on an annual basis, it is sometimes calculated on a quarterly basis as
            well. In the U.S., for example, the government releases an annualized GDP estimate for each fiscal quarter
            and also for the calendar year. The individual data sets included in this report are given in real terms, so
            the data is adjusted for price changes and is, therefore, net of inflation. In the U.S., the Bureau of
            Economic Analysis (BEA) calculates the GDP using data ascertained through surveys of retailers,
            manufacturers, and builders, and by looking at trade flows.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>
        <div id="section2">
          <br><br><br>
          <h3><u>Understanding Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</u></h3><br>
          <p>The calculation of a country's GDP encompasses all private and public consumption, government outlays,
            investments, additions to private inventories, paid-in construction costs, and the foreign balance of trade.
            (Exports are added to the value and imports are subtracted).
          <p>Of all the components that make up a country's GDP, the foreign balance of trade is especially important.
            The GDP of a country tends to increase when the total value of goods and services that domestic producers
            sell to foreign countries exceeds the total value of foreign goods and services that domestic consumers buy.
            When this situation occurs, a country is said to have a trade surplus. If the opposite situation occurs–if
            the amount that domestic consumers spend on foreign products is greater than the total sum of what domestic
            producers are able to sell to foreign consumers–it is called a trade deficit. In this situation, the GDP of
            a country tends to decrease.
          <p>GDP can be computed on either a nominal basis or a real basis, the latter accounting for inflation.
            Overall, real GDP is a better method for expressing long-term national economic performance since it uses
            constant dollars. For example, suppose there is a country that in the year 2009 had a nominal GDP of $100
            billion. By 2019, this country's nominal GDP had grown to $150 billion. Over the same period of time, prices
            also rose by 100%. In this example, if you were to look solely at the nominal GDP, the economy appears to be
            performing well. However, the real GDP (expressed in 2009 dollars) would only be $75 billion, revealing
            that, in actuality, an overall decline in real economic performance occurred during this time</p>

          <br><br><br>
          <h3><u>How to Use GDP Data</u></h3><br>
          <p>Most nations release GDP data every month and quarter. In the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
            publishes an advance release of quarterly GDP four weeks after the quarter ends, and a final release three
            months after the quarter ends. The BEA releases are exhaustive and contain a wealth of detail, enabling
            economists and investors to obtain information and insights on various aspects of the economy.
          <p>GDP's market impact is generally limited, since it is “backward-looking,” and a substantial amount of time
            has already elapsed between the quarter-end and GDP data release. However, GDP data can have an impact on
            markets if the actual numbers differ considerably from expectations. For example, the S&P 500 had its
            biggest decline in two months on Nov. 7, 2013, on reports that U.S. GDP increased at a 2.8% annualized rate
            in Q3, compared with economists’ estimate of 2%. The data fueled speculation that the stronger economy could
            lead the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) to scale back its massive stimulus program that was in effect at the
            time.
          <p>Because GDP provides a direct indication of the health and growth of the economy, businesses can use GDP as
            a guide to their business strategy. Government entities, such as the Federal Reserve in the U.S., use the
            growth rate and other GDP stats as part of their decision process in determining what type of monetary
            policies to implement. If the growth rate is slowing they might implement an expansionary monetary policy to
            try to boost the economy. If the growth rate is robust, they might use monetary policy to slow things down
            in an effort to ward off inflation.
          <p>Real GDP is the indicator that says the most about the health of the economy. It is widely followed and
            discussed by economists, analysts, investors, and policymakers. The advance release of the latest data will
            almost always move markets, though that impact can be limited as noted above.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">GDP and Investing
          <p>Investors watch GDP since it provides a framework for decision-making. The "corporate profits" and
            "inventory" data in the GDP report are a great resource for equity investors, as both categories show total
            growth during the period; corporate profits data also displays pre-tax profits, operating cash flows, and
            breakdowns for all major sectors of the economy. Comparing the GDP growth rates of different countries can
            play a part in asset allocation, aiding decisions about whether to invest in fast-growing economies abroad
            and if so, which ones.
          <p>One interesting metric that investors can use to get some sense of the valuation of an equity market is the
            ratio of total market capitalization to GDP, expressed as a percentage. The closest equivalent to this in
            terms of stock valuation is a company's market cap to total sales (or revenues), which in per-share terms is
            the well-known price-to-sales ratio.
          <p>Just as stocks in different sectors trade at widely divergent price-to-sales ratios, different nations
            trade at market-cap-to-GDP ratios that are literally all over the map. For example, according to the World
            Bank, the U.S. had a market-cap-to-GDP ratio of nearly 165% for 2017 (the latest year for available
            figures), while China had a ratio of just over 71% and Hong Kong had a ratio of 1274%.
          <p>However, the utility of this ratio lies in comparing it to historical norms for a particular nation. As an
            example, the U.S. had a market-cap-to-GDP ratio of 130% at the end of 2006, which dropped to 75% by the end
            of 2008. In retrospect, these represented zones of substantial overvaluation and undervaluation,
            respectively, for U.S. equities.
          <p>The biggest downside of this data is its lack of timeliness; investors only get one update per quarter and
            revisions can be large enough to significantly alter the percentage change in GDP.</p>

          <br><br><br>
          <h3><u>Types of Gross Domestic Product</u></h3><br>
          <p>GDP can be reported in several ways, each of which provides slightly different information.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">Nominal GDP
          <p>Nominal GDP is an assessment of economic production in an economy that includes current prices in its
            calculation. In other words, it doesn't strip out inflation or the pace of rising prices, which can inflate
            the growth figure. All goods and services counted in nominal GDP are valued at the prices that are actually
            sold for in that year. Nominal GDP is evaluated in either the local currency or in U.S. dollars at currency
            market exchange rates in order to compare countries' GDP in purely financial terms.
          <p>Nominal GDP is used when comparing different quarters of output within the same year. When comparing the
            GDP of two or more years, real GDP is used. This is because, in effect, the removal of the influence of
            inflation allows the comparison of the different years to focus solely on volume.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">Real GDP
          <p>Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the quantity of goods and services produced by an
            economy in a given year, with prices held constant from year to year in order to separate out the impact of
            inflation or deflation from the trend in output over time. Since GDP is based on the monetary value of goods
            and services, it is subject to inflation. Rising prices will tend to increase a country's GDP, but this does
            not necessarily reflect any change in the quantity or quality of goods and services produced. Thus, by
            looking just at an economy’s nominal GDP, it can be difficult to tell whether the figure has risen as a
            result of a real expansion in production, or simply because prices rose.
          <p>Economists use a process that adjusts for inflation to arrive at an economy’s real GDP. By adjusting the
            output in any given year for the price levels that prevailed in a reference year, called the base year,
            economists can adjust for inflation's impact. This way, it is possible to compare a country’s GDP from one
            year to another and see if there is any real growth.
          <p>Real GDP is calculated using a GDP price deflator, which is the difference in prices between the current
            year and the base year. For example, if prices rose by 5% since the base year, the deflator would be 1.05.
            Nominal GDP is divided by this deflator, yielding real GDP. Nominal GDP is usually higher than real GDP
            because inflation is typically a positive number. Real GDP accounts for changes in market value, and thus,
            narrows the difference between output figures from year to year. If there is a large discrepancy between a
            nation's real GDP and its nominal GDP, this may be an indicator of either significant inflation or deflation
            in its economy.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">GDP Per Capita
          <p>GDP per capita is a measurement of the GDP per person in a country's population. It indicates the amount of
            output or income per person in an economy can indicate average productivity or average living standards. GDP
            per capita can be stated in nominal, real (inflation-adjusted), or PPP terms. At a basic interpretation, per
            capita GDP shows how much economic production value can be attributed to each individual citizen. This also
            translates to a measure of overall national wealth since GDP market value per person also readily serves as
            a prosperity measure.
          <p>Per capita GDP is often analyzed alongside more traditional measures of GDP. Economists use this metric for
            insight on both their own country's domestic productivity as well as the productivity of other countries.
            Per capita GDP considers both a country's GDP and its population. Therefore, it can be important to
            understand how each factor contributes to the overall result and how each factor is affecting per capita GDP
            growth. If a country’s per capita GDP is growing with a stable population level, for example, it could be
            the result of technological progressions that are producing more with the same population level. Some
            countries may have high per capita GDP but a small population which usually means they have built up a
            self-sufficient economy based on an abundance of special resources.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">GDP Growth
          <p>The GDP growth rate compares the year-over-year (or quarterly) change in a country's economic output in
            order to measure how fast an economy is growing. Usually expressed as a percentage rate, this measure is
            popular for economic policymakers because GDP growth is thought to be closely connected to key policy
            targets such as inflation and unemployment rates.
          <p>If GDP growth rates accelerate, it may be a signal that the economy is "overheating" and the central bank
            may seek to raise interest rates. Conversely, central banks see a shrinking (or negative) GDP growth rate
            (i.e., a recession) as a signal that rates should be lowered and that stimulus may be necessary.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">GDP Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
          <p>While not directly a measure of GDP, economists look at purchasing Power Parity (PPP) to see how one
            country's GDP measures up in "international dollars" using a method that adjusts for differences in local
            prices and costs of living in order to make cross-country comparisons of real output, real income, and
            living standards.</p>

          <h3><u>India's GDP Calculation Process</u></h3><br>
          <p>The GDP in India is calculated using two different methods, leading to different figures that are
            nonetheless close in range.
          <p>The first method is based on economic activity (at factor cost), and the second is based on expenditure (at
            market prices). Further calculations are made to arrive at nominal GDP (using the current market price) and
            real GDP (inflation-adjusted). Among the four released numbers, the GDP at factor cost is the most commonly
            followed figure and reported in the media.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">The Factor Cost Figure
          <p>The factor cost figure is calculated by collecting data for the net change in value for each sector during
            a particular time period. The following eight industry sectors are considered in this cost:
          <p>Agriculture, forestry, and fishing
          <p>Mining and quarrying
          <p>Manufacturing
          <p>Electricity, gas and water supply
          <p>Construction
          <p>Trade, hotels, transport, and communication
          <p>Financing, insurance, real estate, and business services
          <p>Community, social and personal services
          <p>Here is an edited sample report showing an overall GDP change of 6.9%, with a similar percentage change
            across different industry sectors. For example, mining and quarrying declined by 2.9%, while financing,
            insurance, real estate, and business services saw a rise of 10.5%.</p>
          <p><img src="/media/imm.webp">
          <p>Using these numbers, it is easy to see the current state of the economy and its different subsectors.
            Investors can make informed business and investment decisions and the government can implement policies
            accordingly.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">The Expenditure Figure
          <p>The expenditure (at market prices) method involves summing the domestic expenditure on final goods and
            services across various streams during a particular time period. It includes consideration of expenses
            towards household consumption, net investments (i.e., capital formation), government costs, and net trade
            (exports minus imports).
          <p><img src="/media/imm2.webp">
          <p>The GDP numbers from the two methods may not match precisely, but they are close. The expenditure approach
            offers good insight into which parts contribute most to the Indian economy. For example, domestic household
            consumption, which forms 59.5% of the economy, is the reason why India remains unaffected to a good extent
            by economic slowdowns in other parts of the world. Any economy with a high concentration on exports will be
            more susceptible to the effects of global recessions.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">Timelines for India's GDP
          <p>Each quarter’s data are released with a lag of two months from the last working day of the quarter. Annual
            GDP data are released on May 31, with a lag of two months. (The financial year in India follows an
            April-to-March schedule.) The first figures released are quarterly estimates. As more and more accurate
            datasets become available, the calculated figures are revised to final numbers.
          <p>No one knows precisely why India's fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31. Most likely, it's a holdover
            from the centuries of British rule (the U.K. also follows an April-to-March schedule). As it happens, April
            1 marks Vaisakha, the beginning of the Hindu New Year, so the date already has a special "new" meaning for
            many Indians.
          <p>Less romantically, many crops are harvested in February and March. Agriculture remains a significant
            component of the Indian economy. Starting the new year in April allows time to estimate the income from crop
            yields.

          <p style="font-weight:bold;">The Bottom Line
          <p>India calculates GDP in two different ways. Both methods have advantages for the end-user, depending upon
            their needs. To assess the performance of different industry sectors, the factor cost GDP details are
            useful. Expenditure-based GDP calculations indicate how different areas of the economy are
            performing—whether the trade is improving, or whether investments are on the decline.

          <h3><u>Criticisms of GDP</u></h3><br>
          <p>There are, of course, drawbacks to using GDP as an indicator. In addition to the lack of timeliness, some
            criticisms of GDP as a measure are:
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">It ignores the value of informal or unrecorded economic activity –
          <p> GDP relies on recorded transactions and official data, so it does not take into account the extent of
            informal economic activity. GDP fails to account for the value of under-the-table employment, black market
            activity, or unremunerated volunteer work, which can all be significant in some nations. and cannot account
            for the value of leisure time or household production, which are ubiquitous conditions of human life in all
            societies.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">It is geographically limited in a globally open economy –
          <p> GDP does not take into account profits earned in a nation by overseas companies that are remitted back to
            foreign investors. This can overstate a country's actual economic output. For example, Ireland had a GDP of
            $210.3 billion and GNP of $164.6 billion in 2012, the difference of $45.7 billion (or 21.7% of GDP) largely
            being due to profit repatriation by foreign companies based in Ireland.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">It emphasizes material output without considering overall well-being –
          <p> GDP growth alone cannot measure a nation's development or its citizens' well-being, as noted above. For
            instance, a nation may be experiencing rapid GDP growth, but this may impose a significant cost to society
            in terms of environmental impact and an increase in income disparity.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">It ignores business-to-business activity –
          <p> GDP considers only final goods production and new capital investment and deliberately nets out
            intermediate spending and transactions between businesses. By doing so, GDP overstates the importance of
            consumption relative to production in the economy and is less sensitive as an indicator of economic
            fluctuations compared to metrics that include business-to-business activity.
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">It counts costs and waste as economic benefits –
          <p> GDP counts all final private and government spending as additions to income and output for society,
            regardless of whether they are actually productive or profitable. This means that obviously unproductive or
            even destructive activities are routinely counted as economic output and contribute to growth in GDP. For
            example, this includes spending directed toward extracting or transferring wealth between members of society
            rather than producing wealth (such as the administrative costs of taxation or money spent on lobbying and
            rent-seeking), spending on investment projects for which the necessary complementary goods and labor are not
            available or for which actual consumer demand does not exist (such as the construction of empty ghost cities
            or bridges to nowhere unconnected to any road network), and spending on goods and services that are either
            themselves destructive or only necessary to offset other destructive activities, rather than to create new
            wealth (such as the production of weapons of war or spending on policing and anti-crime measures).

    <p>Most people perceive a higher GDP to be a good thing, because it is associated with greater economic
      opportunities and an improved standard of material well-being. It is possible, however, for a country to have a
      high GDP and still be an unattractive place to live, so it is important to also consider other measurements. </p>
    <p>For example, a country could have a high GDP and a low per-capita GDP, suggesting that significant wealth exists
      but it is concentrated in the hands of very few people. One way to address this is to look at GDP alongside
      another measure of economic development, such as the Human Development Index (HDI).</p>

    <p>The countries with the two highest GDPs in the world are the United States and China. However, their ranking
      differs depending on how you measure GDP. Using nominal GDP, the United States comes in first with a GDP of $21.37
      trillion as of 2019, compared to $14.3 trillion for China. Many economists, however, argue that it is more
      accurate to use Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) GDP as a measure for national wealth. By this metric, China is
      actually the world leader, with a PPP GDP of $23.5 trillion, followed by $21.4 trillion for the United States.</p>

    <p>GDP is an important measurement for economists and investors because it is a representation of economic
      production and growth. Both economic production and growth have a large impact on nearly everyone within a given
      economy. When the economy is healthy, there is usually a lower level of unemployment, and wages tend to increase
      as businesses hire more labor to meet the growing demand of the economy. Economists look at positive GDP growth
      between different time periods (usually year-to-year) to make an assessment of how much an economy is flourishing.
      Conversely, if there is negative GDP growth, it may be an indicator that an economy is in or approaching a
      recession or an economic downturn.</p>
    <p>Investors pay attention to the GDP because a significant percentage change in the GDP–either up or down–can have
      a significant impact on the stock market. In general, a bad economy usually means lower earnings for companies.
      And this can translate into lower stock prices.</p>
    <p>Investors may pay attention to positive and negative GDP growth when they are devising an investment strategy.
      However, it's important to note that because GDP is a measurement of the economy in the previous quarter or year,
      it is better used to help explain how economic growth and production have impacted your stocks and your
      investments in the past. It is not considered a helpful predictor of how the market will move in the future.</p>
